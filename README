 Routh Hurwitz Criterion
=========================

Routh Hurwitz criterion is used for finding out stability of a control system
by using its transfer function. For this we form a Routh Hurwitz table and
check the first column. If there are any sign changes in the first column, the
control system is unstable. The system is stable otherwise.

For details refer http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~grogono/Writings/consys.pdf

 Usage
=======

Input
A vector of coefficients of the characteristic equation of the control system.

For ex.
If the control system has the characteristic equation

	A5 s^5 + A4 s^4 + A3 s^3 + A2 s^2 + A1 s^1 + A0 = 0

Vector of coefficients

	>> a = [A5, A4, A3, A2, A1, A0];

Make sure that all the four source files are in working directory.
Run this command to get complete result on using the routh hurwitz criterion.

	>> complete_routh(a);

 Source Files
==============

1. complete_routh.m
   Takes coefficient vector as input and prints the complete
   routh hurwitz table and result accordingly.
   Calls various functions to make routh hurwitz table, check
   for sign changes and completing incomplete table.

2. make_routh_table.m
   Given coefficient vector, this function forms an initial matrix of
   routh table. Then it completes the table by calling inish_incomplete_routh
   function.

3. finish_incomplete_routh.m
   Given an matrix of incomplete routh table and the degree of the
   characteristic equation, this function tries to complete the routh table.
   It exits on its first encounter with 0 as the first element of any row.

4. num_sign_changes.m
   Given the complete routh table, this function analyses its first column
   and returns the number of sign changes occurring.
